# 🔍 PAYSTACK IP WHITELIST DIAGNOSTIC

## 📋 CHECKLIST

### 1. Check Current Paystack IP Whitelist Settings
- [ ] Login to https://dashboard.paystack.com/#/settings/developers
- [ ] Check "IP Whitelisting" section under API Keys
- [ ] Document any whitelisted IPs for test/live keys

### 2. Test Payment Flow
- [ ] Attempt a test payment
- [ ] Check if payment fails with IP-related errors
- [ ] Monitor Edge Function logs for Paystack API errors

### 3. Disable IP Whitelisting (Recommended Fix)
- [ ] Remove all IP addresses from test key whitelist
- [ ] Remove all IP addresses from live key whitelist  
- [ ] Save changes in Paystack dashboard

### 4. Verify Fix
- [ ] Test payment initialization
- [ ] Test payment verification
- [ ] Check payment success rate improvement

## 🚨 LIKELY ROOT CAUSE OF 22.6% SUCCESS RATE

Your current low payment success rate (51/226 orders) is likely caused by:
- ❌ Paystack rejecting API calls from non-whitelisted IPs
- ❌ Random failures as Edge Function IPs change
- ❌ Silent failures in payment processing

## ✅ EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIX

- 🎯 Payment success rate should improve to >85%
- 🎯 Consistent payment processing
- 🎯 Elimination of random API failures

## 🔒 SECURITY NOTE

Disabling IP whitelisting does NOT compromise security because:
- ✅ Secret keys still protect API access
- ✅ Webhook signatures validate authenticity  
- ✅ Supabase Edge Functions provide secure environment
- ✅ Request logging enables monitoring
