## 🚀 Production Deployment Checklist

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Configure SMTP settings in Supabase admin panel
- [ ] Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable for production domains
- [ ] Set `DENO_ENV=production`
- [ ] Verify all email templates are active in database

### SMTP Configuration
- [ ] Test SMTP connection with actual credentials
- [ ] Verify sender email domain SPF/DKIM records
- [ ] Configure email authentication (app passwords if needed)
- [ ] Test email delivery to multiple domains

### Security Configuration
- [ ] Review and adjust rate limits for production volume
- [ ] Set up email suppression list monitoring
- [ ] Configure bounce and complaint handling
- [ ] Enable monitoring and alerting

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Run email system test script: `node scripts/test-email-system.js`
- [ ] Test all critical email flows (registration, orders, etc.)
- [ ] Verify email templates render correctly
- [ ] Test error scenarios and fallbacks

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Deploy EmailHealthMonitor component
- [ ] Set up email delivery monitoring
- [ ] Configure alerting for failure rates > 5%
- [ ] Monitor circuit breaker status

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Check SMTP credentials and app passwords
   - Verify hostname and port configuration
   - Test with basic SMTP client first

2. **Connection Timeouts**
   - Verify network connectivity to SMTP server
   - Check firewall rules for outbound SMTP
   - Consider using different SMTP port (587 vs 465)

3. **Rate Limiting Issues**
   - Review rate limits in EmailRateLimiter configuration
   - Check for rapid-fire email patterns
   - Monitor recipient-specific limits

4. **Template Errors**
   - Verify template exists and is active
   - Check variable names match exactly
   - Test template rendering with sample data

5. **Delivery Failures**
   - Check recipient email format
   - Review SMTP response codes
   - Verify sender reputation and domain records

## 📈 Metrics & Monitoring
