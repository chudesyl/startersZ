## Production-Ready Email System

This project now includes a production-ready email system with the following features:

### ‚úÖ Email Delivery & Reliability
- **Persistent Delivery Logging**: All sent emails are logged to `email_delivery_logs` table with comprehensive tracking
- **Retry Logic**: Failed emails are automatically retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- **Bounce/Complaint Tracking**: Automatic detection and suppression of bad email addresses
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limits to prevent SMTP provider throttling

### üö® Monitoring & Alerting
- **Failure Monitoring**: Automatic detection of repeated email failures
- **Admin Alerts**: Email and Slack notifications for critical issues
- **Health Metrics**: Real-time email system health dashboard
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all email operations

### üîß Configuration

The email system can be configured via environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Admin Email for Critical Alerts
ADMIN_ALERT_EMAIL=admin@your-domain.com

# Slack Integration (Optional)
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK

# Email Failure Monitoring Thresholds
EMAIL_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=5
EMAIL_FAILURE_WINDOW_HOURS=1

# SMTP Rate Limiting Configuration
SMTP_RATE_LIMIT_PER_HOUR=100
SMTP_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=10
SMTP_RATE_LIMIT_BURST=5

# Email Delivery Logging Configuration
EMAIL_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=30
EMAIL_LOG_LEVEL=info

# Email Suppression List Configuration
AUTO_SUPPRESS_HARD_BOUNCES=true
AUTO_SUPPRESS_COMPLAINTS=true
SUPPRESS_AFTER_BOUNCES=3
SUPPRESS_AFTER_COMPLAINTS=1
```

### üìä Email Monitoring Functions

The system includes several Supabase Edge Functions for email monitoring:

- **`email-failure-alerting`**: Monitors for repeated failures and sends alerts
- **`email-production-monitor`**: Provides health metrics and system status
- **`bounce-complaint-processor`**: Handles bounce and complaint events
- **`enhanced-email-retry`**: Manages email retry logic
- **`email-core`**: Core email processing with rate limiting and suppression

### üîç Monitoring Dashboard

Access email delivery metrics via the frontend or by calling:

```sql
-- Get email delivery metrics for last 24 hours
SELECT * FROM get_email_delivery_metrics(24);
```

### üìã Suppression List Management

The system automatically manages email suppressions but you can also manually manage them:

```sql
-- View suppressed emails
SELECT * FROM email_suppression_list WHERE is_active = true;

-- Manually suppress an email
INSERT INTO email_suppression_list (email, suppression_type, reason)
VALUES ('bad@email.com', 'manual', 'Customer requested suppression');
```
